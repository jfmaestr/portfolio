# Hi, I'm Jacob Maestri.

## Who Am I?

I'm a secondary mathematics teacher in Byhalia, MS with experience in Geometry and Algebra I. I'm passionate about effective instruction and learning through the incorporation of technology and innovation to elevate student experiences. Along with math, I enjoy teaching the social and emotional curriculum to promote studentâ€™s human development. Organized. Professional. Collaborative.

## Experience

I've taught since 2019 at [Byhalia High School](http://bhs.marshallcountysd.org/) in Marshall County, Mississippi. I currently teach Algebra I, but have experience with Geometry. I serve as the Math Department Chair and District Mentor Teacher. I'm currently working through [Mississippi Teacher Corps](https://www.mtc.olemiss.edu/) for a Master's of Art in Teaching (M.A.T) anticipated to be completed in May 2021.

## Teaching Things I'm Currently In Love With

I'm always on the lookout for interesting ways to use technology for student engagement. My current favorites include:
1. [Desmos](https://teacher.desmos.com/) (and their wonderfully crafted digital activities)
2. [Gimkit](https://www.gimkit.com/) (their many game modes are relevant and exciting! Students are loving the "Among Us" version recently)
3. [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/) (a classroom review day staple)
4. [Nearpod](https://nearpod.com/) (wow, the pandemic has been terrible in many ways, but one bright side is I learned about Nearpod!)

## My Education

I graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2019 from the University of Arkansas [(woo pig!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXlDOpr_fSk) with a B.S. in Math and additional major in History. I did a undergraduate [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqA9OO2-GjZU0YYOdGfEDJ156PI_XDMu/view?usp=sharing) in [Geometric Group Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_group_theory) under Dr. Matt Clay.
