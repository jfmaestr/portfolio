## You Need to Know a Lot about Cars

If you are going to sell cars (let alone anything!), you need to know a lot about cars! 

We live in a world where saying "I just can't do math" is about as fashionable as it gets. I've even met math teachers who struggle with certain concepts and topics. Content knowledge is often neglected. Math is as simple as doing examples on the board and then monitoring students doing similar examples, right? **WRONG!**

Most of my strides to better understand my content came through creating interactive graphs and activities through [Desmos](https://desmos.com/calculator) and their [Activity Builder](https://teacher.desmos.com) (more on Desmos in sections to come!)

These graphs created interactive experiences for students. Here's an example I created. Your job is to drag the blue and orange points to match the graph to the red points.

This entry point to an activity on vertex form gives students the ability to drag points and discover what each point does without the extra baggage of vocabulary. Students quickly come to realize that the blue point is the "vertex" and the orange point determines the width of the graph. We use that intuitive knowledge to build toward vertex form of a quadratic. None of that conversation about vertex form would be possible without an increased awareness of the content I'm teaching.
