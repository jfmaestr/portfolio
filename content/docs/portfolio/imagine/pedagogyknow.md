Many people can say they know a lot about cars. Maybe they listened to [**Car Talk**](https://www.cartalk.com/) on the weekends too. But, very few can say they know how to sell a car.

This is the hard part: I like to think I know a lot about math. I loved math growing up. I had math teachers that influenced me to pursue math in college. I did [**undergraduate research in mathematics**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqA9OO2-GjZU0YYOdGfEDJ156PI_XDMu/view?usp=sharing). But, when it comes to convincing other people to love math, it's hard. Especially when students have built up [**math trauma**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009155218401200206?journalCode=crwa).

### **Instructional Technology**

You heard it: "The vast majority of Ed-Tech is garbage." That quote comes from [Eli Luberoff](https://twitter.com/eluberoff), CEO of Desmos, one of the fastest growing educational technology companies with a brilliant [middle school curriculum](https://www.desmos.com/curriculum?r=w.hc). Give that full podcast a listen if you have time.

I think Eli is right and I can testify to it as someone who has tried it all. Most of it is garbage. But, there are a few that hit home and I'll highlight how I use them here.

1. [Desmos Activity Builder](https://teacher.desmos.com/): The single best tool for creating math activities. This tool takes the power of the desmos calculator and combines it with facilitation tools that create a front row seat for every student to delight in mathematics. I commited some to becoming comfortable with the [Computation Layer scripts](https://teacher.desmos.com/computation-layer/documentation) to make extra functionality in each activity.

Here is an activity I created based off those principles:

And this is a [collection of activities on quadratics](https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/60083078d152670d30963183) and a [collection on exponentials](https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/601aa5a228e3250d621df6ab) that I used heavily for those respective units.

2. [Edulastic](https://edulastic.com/): This free-to-use assessment tool makes it simple to administer tests and quizzes on student computers. Teacher can actively monitor student progress from their device. Edulastic was helpful when I taught Geometry and other question banks were slim because it wasn't a state tested class. Questions can be pulled from thousands of other teachers or can be created! Here's a look at what my teacher screen would look like.

3. [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com): Google Drive acts as the glue that binds together a lesson. It often is not the feature element of a lesson like Desmos or Edulastic. But, a Google Form Exit Ticket is usually just the right thing to end a lesson. ![image](/exitticket.png)
  Google Docs makes sharing tasks with other teachers or EL and SPED interventionists simple. The list of ways Google Drive binds my classroom together are endless. To further my knowledge of Google Drive, I became a [Level 2 Google Certified Educator](https://www.credential.net/a8aacebd-e5ec-429f-bd4b-e060aca1a05d?key=a90cc95c5c6f7a7b68727edfb87c01512a857d94e20791b8eabc72f1ba33ea2a) which demonstrated "advanced technology implementation skills."

### **Instructional Strategies**

1. Notice and Wonder: Sometimes when introducing students to a topic it's enough to show them an image (graph, equation, table) and ask "What do you notice? What do you wonder?" I found that student grasp the question style better if I preface that "notices" are the things you see and the "wonders" are the questions you have about those "notices."
2. Which One Doesn't Belong: I still have students who lovingly hate this question type and it all stems from the fact that there is usually no correct answer. Before students discuss their reasoning for their selection, I take a poll. Students are at first shy to answer differently from their classmates, but I've had some students embrace that being the only one to select an option means they are thinking differently than everyone else! Students justify their answer and contribute to a discussion on which answer doesn't belong.

2. Estimates First:

5. Card Sorts

### **Problem Solving and Conceptual Understanding**
Desmos has a list of creation principle that I try my best to apply in my own classroom:

### **Reasoning, Communication, Connections, and Representations**

### **Multiple Instructional Strategies for Equity**

### **Data-Driven Instruction**
