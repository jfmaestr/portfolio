# Caring

## Treat Your Market Kindly

A lot of my caring for students begins here with this slide. (Credit to [Kurt Salisbury](https://kurtsalisbury.com/) for this slide!)

Before students complete any math for the day they let me know how they're doing. This 1 minute exercise gives me enough information to tell how a class is doing as a whole and who my outliers might be who are having a rougher day.

Some students even like sharing briefly about why they picked their answers. **"Mr. Maestri, I'm so tired because we got home late from the basketball game!"** Valuable. **"I stayed up late playing the new update to Call of Duty!"** Valuable, but also Get. Some. Sleep. And my favorite: **"I'm feeling wide awake today!"**

And note: this small activity isn't complete without *some* math involved. Students use their skills to understand plotting points on the xy-plane to assess how they are feeling!

### **Taking Feedback to Heart**

Caring comes into play by listening to students and evaluating their feedback. For instance, due to COVID-19,  the school year of 2020-21 required students to do so much more at home. It gave me a glimpse into students lives at home. It took about 4 months of trying to do homework packets that eventually a class of 15 year olds humbled me, saying: "We just don't have time to do the homework. I go home and take care of a sibling. I go home and have to get so much done before my parent gets off work or they get mad. I go home and my mom has all this stuff planned and no time for homework." I didn't realize how little of their time was actually free. I heard their feedback and coming back from Christmas break we got rid of homework packets knowing that we would have to do more in class. And students stepped up.

### **Communication That Works**

My goal for each student's social and emotional learning is to get to a point that they feel comfortable telling me that they are having a bad day. To draw a parallel to math content, this mile stone is their mastery task. If a student can tell me that they are upset or not having a good day on their way into class, then I am prepared to help them.

If that communication doesn't happen at the door and I see a student struggling, it can definitely happen in a hall conference. Giving students a few minutes to breathe in the hall if they are angry or a moment to talk about what is going on, allows students to get the trouble off of them. No student can begin to do math when plagued by anxiety, depression, or stress. I've found those hall moments to be effective ways for students to learn how to process emotions and then return to classroom learning when ready.

In order to learn mathematics, students must feel safe in my classroom. In order to sell the car, I have to make sure the customer had adequate conditions to buy in.
