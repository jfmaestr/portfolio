## Everyone Deserves to Leave the Lot with a High Quality Car.

The people who step onto a used car lot all have varying backgrounds. Some of them judge a good car by how pretty it looks and others know the ins and outs of the catalytic converter, the brake rotors, and everthing in-between. But, it's the job of the salesperson to meet the buyer where they're at. No amateur car buyer wants decades of information about the car. No experienced shopper wants to be belittled with things they already know. All of that knowledge must play into the sellers tactics.

When students enter the classroom, they don't come with the same background. Some come right at the level they are suppose to be. Some very far ahead, some rather far behind. But, in my experience, that adds a beautiful diversity to my classroom. I didn't come to believe that though until a few things had been set in place.

First, it helped when I gave students tasks that were accessible to all students from the very beginning. It took effort to find or create tasks like this, but it served students much better than worksheets or arbitrary steps to solve an arbitrary problem. Here's a task from [Illustrative Mathematics](https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/HS/teachers/1/6/2/index.html) that I adapted for my classroom. This is just but one of many tasks I've given students that ended up going well.

This first task is to qualitatively describe the change in the pattern. Responses ranged from **"I see that both patterns are increasing"** to more descriptive answers like **"The first pattern is changing by 2 every time. The second pattern is not changing by the same amount."** Some students mentioned the shapes of each pattern, mentioning the square shape of the second pattern. But, the kicker is **every student responded** because it was accessible to all students. If I had just done this as an example, many students would have been already zoned out, and the remaining ones would only look to mimick what I had done on the board. 

Students starting with a win propelled us to more challenging questions and discussions about the two patterns. Even wrong answers led to brilliance! Starting with these qualitative answers allowed the playing field to be leveled and students all could contribute.
