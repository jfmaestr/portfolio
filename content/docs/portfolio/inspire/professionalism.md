## Do I Dress the Part?

I try my best to dress like a used carsales person every day. This means patterned button down, old tie, knock off dress shoes to match. During a pandemic, it also means a mask as well.

There were only three weeks between my college graduation and the first lesson I taught in front of students. It felt like such a rush. Teaching was so totally different than college. I felt a lot of control and meaning in what I was doing. But, there were plenty of parts that I didn't expect. The pyschology of my own emotions was one of them.

In my experience, teaching has been a truly emotional endeavor. That was a very unhealthy reality at first. I didn't know how to save my emotions and process them later after I went home for the day. Small things often found their way under my skin. I struggled to emotionally handle a lot of what teaching required. After all, I was an emotional 22 year old who just came bursting out of a college bubble of liberal arts dicussions about geometric group theory and a postmodern study of history. I was like a fish out of water.

Here are a few of the things I learned as best practices when it came to handling my emotions so that I was best prepared to sell some cars (erh, I mean teach math):

1. **Invest in a counselor.** Take the time to process your emotions (especially, in the first years) so that you are not tormented by your own fears and anxiety while you teach. Begin the slow process of reconciling your emotions to what you do every day.
2. **Apologize when you mess up.** Whether this is to your students, to your colleagues, or heck, to yourself, make time to apologize when you mess up. I went into teaching hearing "don't smile. don't let them win. don't give in." That mindset never worked. It wasn't until I humbled myself to apologize that students started the process of creating mutual respect.
3. **Settle your non-negotiables.** Things happened in my classroom that made me dreadfully uncomfortable. In the uncomfortability, I wore my emotions on my sleeve and paid the price. It wasn't until I set my non-negotiables that I felt safe entering my classroom and felt capable of creating that safe place for students. My biggest non-negotiables include no tolerance for discriminating language regarding race, class, gender, religion, etc. It just doesn't happen in my classroom and continuously participating in it requires leaving my room.

Once I had the emotional toolkit ready to create safe place for me and my students, I felt like I had control over myself and my emotions in my classroom. I felt like I was finally dressing the part to make the sale.
