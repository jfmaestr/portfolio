## My Responsiblities Beyond the Dealership

A carsalesman has many responsibilities beyond the dealership. In an ideal world, these extra tasks make you a better salesman.

In my short two years at Byhalia High School, I became the most senior math teacher at the ripe age of 23. I assumed a lot of leadership responsibilities many teachers don't receive until much later in their career. I can definitively say this was not good. It marked a lot of the problems with teacher retention and shortage. But, what I did learn by being thrust into those positions was useful and made me a better educator in the classroom.

I served as Math Department Chair for the 2020-21 school year. This position required strategic planning of math department priorities under a new principal. It often meant arguing and positioning for curriculum and pedagogy that my singular colleague in the department and I believed in. It also meant figuring a lot of things out on my own which was a task that started difficult and got easier over time.

I mentored the other member of the department who began their first year while I was chair. This relationship was meaningful to me in many ways, most importantly to gain a co-worker I trusted and respected and who quickly became a better educator than me in a lot of ways. I enjoyed forming a relationship that felt equal and led to many constructive conversations about how we could best improve our craft.

By sticking around for another year after my first, I learned what it was like to gain additional responsibilities after proving yourself somewhat capable. I began to lead PD sessions in both my school and district. This dialogue with other teachers was an invaluable resource for myself in the classroom. I often found myself leading by simply listening. Those in the meetings knew much more than me and offered much more wisdom.

Leadership in all these roles required a large dose of humility, especially as I was put into those positions while still new and under-qualified. I witnessed a lot ways I could grow in my profession.
