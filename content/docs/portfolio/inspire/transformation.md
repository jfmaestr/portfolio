## Look Within to be a Better Salesperson

No one ever makes a successful first sale. It takes a while before you learn the trade well enough to be confident in making a sale.

I entered teaching as a fresh college graduate. I lived in a world of round table discussions about post-colonial history and whiteboards with math proofs on them. It was an ideal world, but had little roots in reality. Moving to Mississippi meant my first time living somewhere other than where I grew up. It meant the first time moving somewhere I knew no one.

I came seeking doses of reality that I did in fact find. I wanted to taste what life was like for folks in North Mississippi was like and I found exactly that. But, it required a certain amount of growth from myself as a person, as a professional, as a student.

I grew in many dimensions and often felt stretched to a certain limit by that growth. I look back at my very first lesson and laugh now. It feels good to laugh at it and see how green behind the ears I looked.
