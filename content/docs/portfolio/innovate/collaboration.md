# Collaboration

## A Bunch of Car Salespersons Walk into a Room...

In my experience, when math teachers all get together to chat a few things come up over and over again. Here's a few of those:

* "My students just aren't interested in math"
* "Students are really struggling with word problems"
* "There is just too much on the curriculum calendar"

The list could go on. Conversations around these topics can be helpful, others not. But, I've found that collaboration, whether forced or freely done, is a great avenue to move past the pleseantries of math teacher problems since immemorial and begin to craft a vision for a classroom.

Here is my story with my most recent collaborator, Mr. Che:

Mr. Che was assigned to me as a mentee teacher. It was my job to help him orient himself as a new teacher and show him the ropes to what teaching math looks like. Our professional relationship has evolved to much more than that over the past year.

Mr. Che is passionate about learning. He is interested in a wide variety of fields and is much more widely read than I am. I admire that in a collaborator. He has challenged me in lots of ways. I admire the collaboration we've done because it comes from a place of **humility**. We approach our job knowing we are far from the very best we want to be. It allows us room to grow.

Decisions we have made together involve curriculum pacing, lesson design, task creation. We've done it all together. The beauty of creating those things is the open and caring environment we have created to explore new possibilities without judgement.

Good collaboration starts with good resources. Mr. Che and I are always sharing new and interesting resources we find and we openly use them and share the results with each other. This approach to the classroom is refreshing to the comments I mentioned at the very beginning. We go beyond the typical conversations of "Oh those kids" and "math is just boring." We do that because we ultimately reject those claims made in math teacher PD. We want a new vision for the math classroom.

To become a great car salesman (or anything really) requires positioning yourself around folks who will help build you up humbly.
