# Assessment

## What's the Current Buying Rate?

Salesfolks need to stay up to date with the current buying rate **constantly**. If you don't where your buyer is at, you won't make the sale either.

In my classroom, the main way I evaluate student learning is through **exit tickets**.

Exit Tickets serve two purposes:

1. Evaluate mastery of the learning goal.
2. Evaluate student perception of mastery.

Exit tickets utilize the same google form template every day in my classroom. Students know what to expect because it is consistent. It usually looks like this.

First, I organize students by their indentifying information. This makes it simple to identify students individually and by class block.

Second, once I know who a student is I can create a formative assessment that evaluates the days learning goal. It usually only takes about one question to assess this and it usually involves a longer form answer. In my experience, multiple choice exit tickets do not evaluate student learning well since they provide little information into what a student was thinking.

Third, there is sometimes a disconnect between what a student can show when asked a question and how they describe how they did that day. So, I allow a student to evaluate for themselves their own learning. Using a scale of 1-10 works well to quantitatively evaluate, but students are also allowed to type their own understanding of their learning when asked "anything I should know about your learning today?"

Exit tickets are the daily pulse of my classroom. They grant me a quick access into the mind of each student and also make it simple to draw trends between blocks. As a Google Form, the answers can be processed into a easy to use Google Sheet.

If I can gauge whether the students are buying what I'm selling, I can easily make adjustments to pace, content, delivery, and instructional strategies.
