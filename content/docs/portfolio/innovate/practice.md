## Does the Dealership Look Nice?

Most folks think the dealership should pop with modern design and vibrant colors. I think differently. The dealership should be designed to achieve your main goal.

In my math classroom, my main goal is getting students to think critically. I've shown that in the tasks I give students, in the ways I assess them, and in the pedagogical practices I implement. But, there is one element of design I think makes my classroom unique.

The **upside down map** is a staple in my classroom. When I first hung it up, students thought weirdly of it. I got a lot of "why is it upside down?" and "Mr. Maestri you are a weirdo." But, I quickly tried to make a learning opportunity out of it. I asked "What direction is at the top of the map?" and students all answer "North!" I follow up: "And who says so?" I've gotten many responses of which my favorite are "God" and "the government."

I want students to enter my room ready to flip the script on how to think. Part of thinking critically is being able to question even the most engrained ideas in our brains. The upside map is a fundamental visual cue to that end in my classroom.

I also fimrly believe that students should utilize **all of the room** to learn. This meant having students walking around the room for stations involving quick problems to tackle in small groups.

Right triangle trigonometry and transversals required putting images of them on the floor with tape! We played a few games of "Dance Dance Transversal" and "Dance Dance Trigonometry" both of which were references to a game that immeadiately went over students heads.

Even the color of the room can be used to help brighten what happens in the room. My dad came and helped me paint my room in January 2020.

The room might just be four walls. It might have desks in rows. But, I've come to find that even with those simple things a room can come alive with the elements necessary to inspire thinking.
