# Being a Math Teacher Is Like Selling Used Cars.

About halfway through my second year of teaching I watched this video that features Dan Meyer talking about his experience of being a math teacher. The video is over 10 years old now, but it helped me lean into an important fact: I am a used cars salesman, **"selling a product to a market"** as Dan says **"that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it."**

Take a second to watch a little bit of Dan's genius.

Watching this video was a turning point in my career so far. It led to discovering people much smarter than I am (good teaching is theft anyways, right?) who showed me the power, necessity, and delighfulness of math. I felt like I came to love a subject I've always held dear over and over and over because of it. This portfolio documents how I've grown in and around the idea of this video (that my classroom needed a makeover) and the impact that has had on my students and my colleagues.

Being a math teacher is like selling used cars. But, once I knew that, things became a lot more clear.
