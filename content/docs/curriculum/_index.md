Long-Term Curriculum Goals:
1. Create a DOK matrix (similar to the one found [here](https://robertkaplinsky.com/depth-of-knowledge-matrix-algebra-1/)) for whatever the major content standards for whatever course I'm teaching in Fall 2021.
2. Create Unit Plans for courses in Fall 2021 that include main topics, skills, essential questions, and lesson outlines.
3. Store lesson materials for each lesson on a specific webpage. (This may not happen Fall 2021)
