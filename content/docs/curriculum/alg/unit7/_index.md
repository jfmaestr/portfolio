## Overview
Students have learned skills regarding functions in individual context (linear, quadratic, exponential). This unit serves to engage students to compare and contrast the models already learned. Students will be able to create models when give a verbal description of a concrete application. By introducing piecewise functions, students are able to model more complex situations.

## Main Topics with Essential Questions
- **Linear, Quadratic, or Exponential** (Lessons 1, 2, 3, 4):
  - Students will differentiate between function models when given their tables.
  - Students will compare and contrast the graphs of functions using their knowledge of the various models.
  - Students will interpret domain and range and draw inferences on how domain and range change with each model.
  - Students will interpret key features of graphs and draw inferences on how those changes with each model.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do the various algebraic models change in a given context?
      - What are the similarities and differences between the various algebraic models?
    - Standards: [F-IF.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/A/1/), [F-IF.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/5/), [F-IF.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/4/), [F-LE.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/), [F-LE.1.a](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/a/), [F-LE.1.b](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/b/), [F-LE.1.c](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/c/)
- **Piecewise Functions** (Lessons 8, 9):
  - Students will graph piecewise models from concrete applications.
  - Students will identify the domain and range of a piecewise function using interval notation.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - What applications require a piecewise function?
      - How can we develop a language to communicate domain and range of a piecewise function?
    - Standards: [F-IF.2](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/A/2/), [F-IF.7.b](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/7/b/)
- **Review of Function Basics** (Lessons 6, 7):
  - Students will determine if a relation is a function when presented with a table, mapping diagram, or list of ordered pair.
  - Students will explain why the vertical line test proves a graph is a function.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How does each model of a function explain a different concept regarding functions? When is each type of model useful?
      - How does the vertical line test prove that a graph is a function?
    - Standards: [F-IF.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/A/1/)
- **Modeling Functions** (Lessons 11, 12, 13):
  - Students will determine which model (linear, quadratic, exponential) works best with a given problem.
  - Students will create models for concrete applications, determine their accuracy and useful, and modify if necessary.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do I choose which model fits this example best?
      - How can I use the parameters of a model to fit data or a scenario?
    - Standards: [F-LE.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/), [F-LE.2](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/2/), [F-LE.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/B/5/)

## Vocabulary
- **Domain**: the set of inputs of a function.
- **Range**: the set of outputs of a function.
- **Function**: a relation that has one output for ever input.
- **Linear Model**: {{<katex>}} y=mx+b {{</katex>}}
- **Quadratic Model**: {{<katex>}} y=ax^2+bx+c {{</katex>}}
- **Exponential Model**: {{<katex>}} y= a \cdot b^{kx} {{</katex>}}
- **Piecewise Function**: a function built from pieces of different functions over different intervals.
- **Relative Maximum**: a point where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing.
- **Relative Minimum**: a point where the graph changes from decreasing to increasing.
- **Y-Intercept**: the point where the graph crosses the y-axis.
- **X-Intercept**: the point where the graph crosses the x-axis.
