## Overview
Many of the themes of the previous two units (linear and quadratic functions) come to a completion in this unit on **exponential functions.** Students will be able to interpret exponential change from graphs, tables, and functions. Transformations make a third appearance as students again use their pattern recognition to investigate how function manipulation effects graphs. Students begin to correlate verbal descriptions of mathematical functions with their algebraic counterparts. Students investigate concrete examples of exponential functions through disease spread, the zombie apocalypse, and compound interest.

## Main Topics with Essential Questions
1. **Graphs, Tables, Functions** (Lesson 1-3):
  - Students will distinguish between linear, quadratic, and exponential functions from their graphs, tables, functions, and verbal descriptions.
  - Students will plot exponential graphs from functions or tables.
  - Students will identify key features of the graph of an exponential function (intercepts, end behavior, etc.)
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do linear, quadratic, exponential functions differ from each other? How can I see that in the forms I'm familiar with (graph, table, function)?
      - How can I apply my knowledge of key features to graphs of an exponential function?
    - Standards: [F-BF.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/BF/A/1/), [F-LE.1.a](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/1/a/), [F-LE.2](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/2/), [F-IF.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/4/), [F-IF.8.b](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/8/b/)
2. **Transformations** (Lesson 4, 6):
  - Students will investigate how changes in the algebraic representation of an exponential function will modify its graph.
  - Students will determine how rate of growth and decay effects a graph.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do changes in the form of an exponential function effect its graph?
    - Standards: [F-BF.3](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/BF/B/3/), [F-IF.8](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/8/)
3. **Concrete Applications** (Lesson 7-8):
  - Students will give meaning to the key features of a function in concrete applications.
  - Students will create exponential functions to model concrete applications.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - What type of problems require an exponential model?
      - How do the key features represent concrete ideas in application?
    - Standards: [F-LE.2](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/A/2/), [F-LE.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/LE/B/5/)

## Vocabulary
- **Growth/Decay Rate**: the rate at which an exponential function gets bigger or smaller, often represented as a percent.
- **Exponential Growth**: a rate of growth that multiplies over equal proportions.
- **End Behavior**: the behavior of a graph as a function tends towards {{<katex>}} \infty {{</katex>}} or {{<katex>}} -\infty {{</katex>}}
- **Y-Intercept**: the point {{<katex>}} (x,y) {{</katex>}} where a graph crosses the y-axis.
