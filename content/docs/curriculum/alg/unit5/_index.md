## Overview

Students are thoroughly familiar with linear equations before stepping foot into the Algebra I classroom. They can (usually) already interpret slope and y-intercept from a graph and concrete applications. In this unit, the first foreign concept is introduced: quadratics. Students will master methods of manipulating quadratics and their functions, graphs, and applications.

## Main Topics with Essential Questions

1. **Graphs, Tables, Functions** (Lessons 1, 4, 6, 7):
  - Students will manipulate quadratic objects into a meaningful form for problem solving.
  - Students will identify the best form of a quadratic (graph, function, or table) for problem solving.
  - Students will understand the need for standardized forms of quadratics and be accustomed to each form (standard, vertex, factored).
  - Students will identify domain and range of a quadratic function from tables and graphs.
  - Students will distinguish linear and quadratic functions from tables through rate of change.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How does the use of a graph, function, or table impact how I can solve a particular problem?
      - Which way of thinking about a quadratic is most suitable for this problem?
      - How do the graphical concepts of linear functions (domain, range, intercepts, rate of change) apply to quadratic contexts?
    - Standards: [F-IF.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/5/), [F-IF.6](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/6/), [F-IF.8.A](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/8/a/), [F-IF.9](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/9/), [A.SSE.3.a](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/SSE/B/3/a/)

2. **Transformations** (Lessons 2, 3):
  - Students will interpret vertex form functions and match them with the appropriate graphs.
  - Students will write a vertex form function for a given graph.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How does changing the written form of the quadratic change the graph? And vice-versa?
    - Standards: [F-IF.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/B/4/), [F-BF.3](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/BF/B/3/)

3. **Solving Quadratics** (Lesson 8, 9):
  - Students will solve quadratics in any form by plotting the solution in [Desmos](https://desmos.com) and locating the roots.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - What is the significance of solving for a quadratics roots? I.e. What are the mathematical benefits of solving for {{< katex >}} f(x) = 0 {{< /katex >}}.
    - Standards: [A-REI.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/REI/B/4/), [A-REI.11](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/REI/D/11/), [F-IF.7.a](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSF/IF/C/7/a/)

4. **Concrete Applications** (Lesson 11, 12, 13):
  - Students will interpret the meaning of the y-intercept and roots of quadratic functions in concrete applications.
  - Students will interpret the meaning of the vertex in concrete applications.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do the parts of a quadratic (vertex, roots, y-intercept) explain phenomenon in concrete applications of quadratics?
    - Standards: [A-CED.3](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/CED/A/3/)

## Vocabulary
- **Parabola**: the shape of a quadratic function
- **Vertex**: the maximum or minimum point of a parabola
- **Y-Intercept**: the point {{< katex >}} (x,y) {{< /katex >}} where a graph crosses the y-axis.
- **Roots**: the solutions to the function {{<katex>}} f(x)=0 {{</katex>}}.
- **Axis of Symmetry**: the line by which the quadratic can be reflected over.
- **X-Intercept**: the point {{< katex >}} (x,y) {{< /katex >}} where a graph crosses the x-axis. Equivalent to the **roots** of the function.
- **Vertex Form**: the form of a quadratic that emphasizes the vertex: {{<katex>}} y = a(x-h)^2 +k {{< /katex >}}
- **Standard Form**: the form of a quadratic that emphasizes factorability: {{<katex>}} y = ax^2 +bx+c {{</katex>}}
- **Factored Form**: the form of a quadratic the emphasizes the roots (solutions to {{<katex>}} f(x)=0 {{< /katex >}}): {{<katex>}} f(x)=(ax+b)(cx+d) {{</katex>}}
