# Unit 1: Statistics (or What Happens When Things Aren't Perfect)

## Overview
Algebra is often focused on the perfect. Models fit perfectly with their verbal descriptions. Students quickly question why this happens so well. Statistics provides learning opportunities of dealing with imperfect data and drawing one best conclusion out of many possible. Students investigate many forms of collecting, organizing, and analyzing data sets in one or two variables.

## Main Topics with Essential Questions
- **Organizing Data in Charts**
  - Students will create dot plots, histograms, and box plots for different data sets.
  - Students will determine usefulness of different visualizations of data sets.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do different methods of visualizing data emphasize different structure in our data?
    - Standards: [S-ID.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/A/1/)
- **Measures of Center and Spread**
  - Students will describe data sets using measures of spread and center.
  - Students will determine which measure of center fits best based on the shape of the data set.
  - Students will investigate how outliers effect a distribution's measure of center and spread.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do measures of spread and center describe a data set?
      - Which measure of center is appropriate in this given context?
      - How do outliers effect measures of center and spread?
    -Standards: [S-ID.2](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/A/2/), [S-ID.3](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/A/3/)
- **Frequency Tables**
  - Students will draw conclusions about data sets from two way frequency tables.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - What conclusions can I draw from data organized in a two way frequency tables?
    - Standards: [S-ID.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/B/5/))
- **Scatter Plot and Lines of Best Fit**
  - Students will plot data sets on scatter plots.
  - Students will choose an appropriate model to match the scatter plot.
  - Students will create lines of best fit and discuss their reasoning for their choices.
  - Students will interpret the parameters (slope and y-intercept) of a linear model.
  - Students will discuss causation and correlation and distinguish between the two.
    - **Essential Questions**:
      - How do the functions models I've learned about fit into less-than-perfect scenarios (i.e. scatter plots)?
      - What qualities of a line of best fit make it a good fit for the data set I'm given?
      - What conclusions can I draw from the parameters (slope and y-intercept) of my line of best fit?
      - If two variables are correlated, does one of them cause the others? Why or why not?
    - Standards: [S-ID.6](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/B/6/), [S-ID.6.a](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/B/6/a/), [S-ID.6.b](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/B/6/b/), [S-ID.6.c](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/B/6/c/), [S-ID.7](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/C/7/), [S-ID.8](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/C/8/), [S-ID.9](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSS/ID/C/9/)
